Why Our Project is Not Open Source


We’ve chosen not to open-source our app, and we want to explain why. While we respect the open-source community and its importance, our platform is built with a specific business model in mind. As a centralized service that leverages the Stellar network, we need to maintain control over the features and user experience to ensure security, privacy, and consistent updates.
Keeping our codebase proprietary helps us protect our intellectual property and the unique integrations we’ve developed. It also ensures we can provide a smooth, reliable service for users without the challenges of managing an open-source project. Our goal is to offer a high-quality, sustainable platform that can scale effectively.
That being said, we’re still committed to transparency. We’ll continue to share technical updates, documentation, and engage with the community in other ways. We also look forward to collaborating with developers and contributing to the broader ecosystem where possible.


Current status for Analytics 

At this stage, we do not have public analytics available, as the platform is still in the early phases of development. Once we start onboarding users and generating transaction data, we plan to integrate with analytics platforms like Dune Analytics and DefiLlama to provide real-time insights into user activity, transaction volume, and liquidity metrics. For now, we are focused on building out these integrations to ensure transparent, accessible data for our community.
